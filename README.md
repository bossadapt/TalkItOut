Charade-like game for Android. You can copy and paste lists to parse or build the lists from scratch to play through. There are settings to make the games more or less challenging.

How to use:
One person holds out of sight of themselves and allows the people around them to give hints(however you would like) until the person holding it says it out loud or skips it by tapping the other side of the screen.
